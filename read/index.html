            <!--<h2>Preface</h2>-->
            <!--<p class="first-paragraph"><span class="first-line">I never intended to write</span>-->
                <!--a novella, it just—sort of—happened. Back when I penned Part I,-->
                <!--which would later be titled With Sensual Red Lips, I never meant-->
                <!--for it to be more than a one-off, self-indulgent collection of-->
                <!--literary cliches.</p>-->
            <!--<p>But then my wife asked, “What happened next?”</p>-->
            <!--<p>To which I, of course, had no reply because it had never crossed-->
                <!--my mind that it would go anywhere at all.</p>-->
            <!--<p>And now, rather than to tell you this beautiful tale about how-->
                <!--she had stirred something deep inside me, I will instead tell-->
                <!--you the real reason I continued with this story. The real reason-->
                <!--that a short one-off grew from its humble origin of a 1 000-->
                <!--words into the—still quite humble—10 000 word novella you now-->
                <!--have before you.</p>-->
            <!--<p>Sure, the real reason isn’t nearly as complex or nuanced as a-->
                <!--blatant lie would be. In fact, I think you’ll find that my-->
                <!--reason is quite mundane, but at least it’s mine.</p>-->
            <!--<p>&nbsp;</p>-->
            <!--<p>I, simply, wanted to please her curiosity.</p>-->
            <!--<p>&nbsp;</p>-->
            <!--<p>Now, to those of you who have already read this story, there-->
                <!--isn’t <em>really</em> any reason for you to read it again, you-->
                <!--know how the story goes; Boy takes one last job to make rent,-->
                <!--boy dies at the end.</p>-->
            <!--<p>But if you’ll indulge me one more time, I think I can make it-->
                <!--worth your while. Because, although the main story has remained-->
                <!--intact, a smaller—more personal—story emerged. One that I hadn’t-->
                <!--anticipated. And rather than try to fight it, I gave in to it-->
                <!--and made it a part of the original story.</p>-->
            <!--<p>Finally by going through and editing, I could tidy up all those-->
                <!--loose ends I had left behind and structure what had lacked a lot-->
                <!--of focus in its infancy. And I think it’s better for it. I hope-->
                <!--you’ll feel the same way.</p>-->

            <h2>Everybody’s looking for something</h2>
            <p class="first-paragraph"><span class="first-line">“Alexa, play Cleaning mix volume two.”</span></p>
            <p>The computer responded with its tell-tale blip confirming that it has heard him and the synthesizer riff of Sweet Dreams by Eurythmics began echoing through the unloved living room.</p>
            <p>“Sweet dreams are made of this. Who am I to disagree? I travel the world and the seven seas, everybody’s looking for something,” the vocals bounce off the weathered couch and into the bathroom where Trevor is cleaning his blood-stained t-shirt.</p>
            <p>All the soap in the world can’t alleviate the force he had to put into scrubbing.</p>
            <p>“Trevor,” Benny called out from the living room, “You were fucking sloppy tonight.”</p>
            <p>“I know, I know.”</p>
            <p>“Oh you do? Then get it right next time. You almost got caught. Do you wanna get caught?”</p>
            <p>“You know I don—”</p>
            <p>“—Then get your shit together.”</p>
            <p>“Would you just let me clean this first and then we can—”</p>
            <p>“No. I’m talking now, so we’re talking now.”</p>
            <p>“What if I don’t wanna talk Benny?”</p>
            <p>“Some of them want to abuse you,” Annie Lennox’s voice filled the silence, “Some of them want to be abused.”</p>
            <p>The voice sighed, “I’m sorry Trevor. I didn’t mean to be harsh. But you know we need to talk. Who else are you gonna talk to?”</p>
            <p>Moving his elbows up and down vigorously, Trevor was trying to get the stain out of the collar of his favorite Iron Maiden t-shirt. The barely readable print on its back, “Somewhere on tour 87,” peeled off a little bit more with every wash it goes through.</p>
            <p>“Why did that fucking asshole have to change his routine—I’m never gonna get this clean,” Trevor looked as though he was about to start crying.</p>
            <p>“Because people are unreliable as fuck,” Benny said, “You all have a habit of doing the opposite of what you’re supposed to.”</p>
            <p>“You used to be better at thinking on your feet Trevor. You’ve gotten sloppy lately.”</p>
            <p>“I’ve had a lot on my mind Benny, you know that—”</p>
            <p>“I know, I know,” Benny interrupted, “Keep this up though and soon you won’t have anyone to talk to.”</p>
            <p>The song transitioned into its familiar bridge, “Hold your head up. Keep your head up, movin’ on. Hold your head up, movin’ on.”</p>
            <p>Trevor buried his pruning fingers into his receding hairline. Crushed by defeat he looked at the remains of the t-shirt.</p>
            <p>“It’s fine, I can still wear this,” he said.</p>
            <p>Folding it across the bathtub edge he got up and looked at the gash on his bloodstained cheek. His glazed sleep-deprived eyes stared back at his unkempt beard, “When did I last shave?”</p>
            <p>“Three weeks ago,” Benny’s voice pierced through the fading synthesizer riff, “You had shaved the morning we met.”</p>
            <p>“Met?” Trevor said, “If you can call it that?”</p>
            <p>“Semantics my friend. I’m here now, that’s all that matters.”</p>
            <p>Trevor turned on the hot water tap only to remember that it didn’t work. He had complained to Ryan the indifferent motel clerk about it the day after he had checked-in.</p>
            <p>After a week of no hot water Trevor had lost all hope that Ryan would, “Look into it right away sir,” as he had assured him with the expressionless face only a seventeen year-old who had his first summer job could do.</p>
            <p>“Fucking teenagers,” he said rubbing his cheek to wash away the dried blood from it and opening up the wound again, “Fuck!”</p>
            <p>“The styptic is in your ugly bag,” Benny said.</p>
            <p>Holding the last few sheets of the toilet paper to his now bleeding cheek Trevor rushed to the living room where Benny and his bag was sitting on the table.</p>
            <p>Going through the bag one-handed and throwing everything on the floor he eventually found the styptic, dabbing it to his wound for that familiar burning sensation.</p>
            <p>The bleeding stopped.</p>
            <p>“Better?” Benny asked sitting next to him.</p>
            <p>Trevor looked at his blood-stained gun, the Beretta M9 semi-automatic pistol—Benny for short—and replied, “Not really. My t-shirt is still ruined.”</p>
            <p>“Yeah, well, I’m still covered in that unreliable fuck’s blood so I guess we’re both having a bad day,” Benny said, “Now how about you strip and clean me too. I don’t want this shit to dry and clog me up for Sunday.”</p>
            <p>“Sunday?”</p>
            <p>“The afternoon gig on Sunday,” Benny replied, “I’m not your personal assistant, look at your fucking calendar some time.”</p>
            <p>Trevor put back the styptic, socks and notebooks into the bag. Taking out the gun cleaning equipment he began to disassemble Benny piece by piece laying them down on the oil-covered cloth.</p>
